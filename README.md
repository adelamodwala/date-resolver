## Date Resolver

# A constraint based date finder
This application helps you find a date (for an event or outing) based on your constraints.

Some use cases:
- Date must be after July 23 and can't be Saturdays
- Date must fall on either a Thursday or Sunday but before January 7
- Date must fall in December or January, can't be Tuesdays or Thursdays, must be 3 days in a row.
- Etc... you get the picture ;)

All use cases won't be supported just yet so consider this a partial wish list of features.

BTW this app is currently just client side straight up React + Redux.
